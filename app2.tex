\chapter{Booster Neutrino Beam}
\label{app:B}


ANNIE is run off the Booster Neutrino Beam in Fermilab.
Fermilab Booster accelerates the protons up to 8 GeV kinetic energy.
Selected spills containing approximately 4-5x10 12 protons are extracted and %
bent toward the BNB target hall.
Each spill contains 81 bunches of protons, approximately 6 nsec wide each and 19 nsec apart, %
for a total spill duration of 1.6 usec.
The typical beam alignment and divergence, measured by the beam position %
monitors located near the target, are within 1 mm and 1 mrad of the nominal target center %
and axis direction, respectively.
The typical beam focusing on target measured by the beam profile monitors is of the order %
of 1-2 mm (RMS) in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
The number of protons delivered to the BNB target for each spill is measured with a %
2\% accuracy using two toroidal current transformers (often referred to as toroidâ€™s) %
located near the target along the beamline.
These parameters are well tuned within the experiment requirements.
