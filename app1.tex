\chapter{Booster Neutrino Beam}
\label{app:A}

 %Arxiv 1311.5958v1.
 %Fermilab has two major neutrino beamlines: the Neutrino Main Injector (NuMI) and %
 %the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB).
 %The energy range of these two neutrino sources on-axis is in the GeV range, %
 %which is too high to satisfy the condition for dominance of coherent scattering. 
 %The far-off-axis (> $45^\circ$) of the BNB produces well defined neutrinos with %
 %energies below 50 MeV.
 %The BNB source has substantial advantages over the NuMI beam source owing to suppressed %
 %kaon production from the relatively low energy 8 GeV proton beam on the target~ref. 
 %Therefore, pion decay and subsequent muon decay processes are the dominant sources of neutrinos. 
 %At the far-off-axis area, the detector can be placed close enough to the target to gain a %
 %large increase in neutrino flux due to the larger solid angle acceptance.

 \section{BNB details}
 %An initial study using the existing BNB MC has confirmed that this approach is promising.
 %The Fermilab Booster is a 474-meter-circumference synchrotron operating at 15 Hz. 
 %Protons from the Fermilab LINAC are injected at 400 MeV and accelerated to 8 GeV kinetic energy. 
 %The structure of the beam is a series of 81 proton bunches each with a 2 ns width and 19 ns apart. 
 %The maximum average repetition rate for proton delivery to the BNB is 5 Hz and 5 x 10 12 protons %
 %per pulse. 
 %The repetition limit is set by the horn design and its power supply. 
 %The target is made of beryllium divided in seven cylindrical sections in a total of \np{71.1}~cm %
 %in length and 0.51 cm in radius.
 %In order to minimize up-stream proton interactions, the vacuum of the beam pipe extends to %
 %about 152 cm upstream of the target.
 %The horn is an aluminum alloy toroidal electromagnet with operating values of 174 kA and %
 %maximum field value of 1.5 Tesla. 
 %A concrete collimator is located downstream of the target and guides the beam into the decay region.
 %The air-filled cylindrical decay region extends for 45 meters. 
 %The beam stop is made of steel and concrete.

 %The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) booster is a 474-meter-circumference %
 %synchrotron operating at 15 Hz. 
 %Protons from the Fermilab LINAC are injected at 400 MeV and accelerated to 8 GeV kinetic %
 %energy (8:89 GeV=c momentum).
 %he booster has a harmonic number of 84, of which 81 buckets are filled. 
 %Thebeam is extracted into the BNB using a fast-rising kicker that extracts all of the particles %
 %in a single turn.
 %The resulting structure is a series of 81 bunches of protons each 2 ns wide and 19 ns apart.
 %Upon leaving the booster, the proton beam is transported through a lattice of focusing %
 %and defocusing quadrupole (FODO) and dipole magnets.
 %A switch magnet steers the beam to the main injector or to the BNB. 
 %The BNB is also a FODO that terminates with a triplet that focuses the beamon the target. 
 %The design and measured optics of BNB are in agreement [7,8].
 %The maximum allowable average repetition rate for delivery of protons to the BNB is %
 %5 Hz (with a maximumof 11 pulses in a row at 15 Hz) and 5 x 10to12 protons-per-pulse. 
 %The 5 Hz limit is set by the design of the horn (described below) and its power supply.
 
 %The target consists of seven identical cylindrical slugs of beryllium arranged to produce a %
 %cylinder 71.1 cm long and 0.51 cm in radius. 
 %The target is contained within a beryllium sleeve 0.9 cm thick with an inner radius of 1.37 cm.
 %Each target slug is supported within the sleeve by three ``fins'' (also beryllium) %
 %which extend radially out from the target to the sleeve. 
 %The volume of air within the sleeve is circulated to provide cooling for the target when the beam %
 %line is in operation. 
 %The target and associated assembly are shown in Fig.~2, where the top figure shows an exploded %
 %view of the various components (with the downstream end of the target on the right), %
 %and the bottom shows the components in assembled form. 
 %The choice of beryllium as the target material was motivated by residual radioactivity issues %
 %in the event that the target assembly needed to be replaced, as well as energy loss %
 %considerations that allow the air-cooling system to be sufficient.
 %Upstream of the target, the primary proton beam is monitored using four systems: %
 %two toroids measuring its intensity (protons-per-pulse), beam position monitors %
 %(BPM) and a multiwire chamber determining the beam width and position, %
 %and a resistive wall monitor (RWM) measuring both the time and intensity of the beam spills.
 %The vacuum of the beam pipe extends to about 5 feet upstream of the target, %
 %minimizing upstream proton interactions.
 %The toroids are continuously calibrated at 5 Hz with their absolute calibrations verified %
 %twice a year.
 %The calibrations have shown minimal deviation ( < 0:5\%).
 %The proton flux measured in the two toroids agree to within 2\%, compatible with the %
 %expected systematic uncertainties.
 %The BPMs are split-plate devices that measure the difference of charge induced on two plates. 
 %By measuring the change in beam position at several locations without intervening optics, %
 %the BPMs are found to be accurate to 0.1 mm (standard deviation). 
 %The multiwire is a wire chamber with 48 horizontal and 48 vertical wires and 0.5 mm pitch. 
 %The profile of the beam is measured using the secondary emission induced by the beam on the wires.
 %The RWM is located upstream of the target to monitor the time and intensity of the proton %
 %pulses prior to striking the target. 
 %While the data from the RWM did not directly entere analysis, it allowed many useful cross %
 %checks, such as those shown in Fig. 3.
 %The left figure shows a comparison of the production times of neutrinos observed %
 %in the MiniBooNE detector estimated based on the vertex and time reconstructed by the detector %
 %and subtracting the time-of-flight. 
 %This time is then compared to the nearest bucket as measured by the RWM. 
 %The distribution indicates that neutrino events can be matched not only to pulses %
 %from the booster, but to a specific bucket within the pulse.
 %The tails of the distribution result from the resolution of the vertex reconstruction %
 %of the neutrino event in the detector, which is needed to determine the time of the %
 %event and correct for the time-of-flight.
 %The right plot demonstrates the synchronization of the horn pulse (described in Sec. II C) %
 %with the delivery of the beam as measured by the RWM.
 
 %The horn current pulse is approximately a half-sinusoid of amplitude 174 kA, 143 s long, %
 %synchronized to each beam spill. 
 
 %The typical beam alignment and divergence measured by the beam position monitors located %
 %near the target are within 1 mm and 1 mrad of the nominal target center and axis direction, %
 %respectively; the typical beam focusing on target measured by beam profile monitors is %
 %of the order of 1–2 mm [root mean square(RMS)] in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
 %These parameters are well within the experiment requirements. 
 %The number of protons delivered to the BNB target is measured for each proton %
 %batch using two toroids located near the target along the beam line. 
 %The toroid calibration, performed on a pulse-by-pulse basis, provides a measurement %
 %of the number of protons to BNB with a 2\,\% accuracy.
 %Primary protons from the 8 GeV beam line strike a thick beryllium target located %
 %in the BNB target hall.
 
 %The SciBooNE hall is on axis from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at 8 m below the surface.
 %The BNB impinges 8.89 GeV/c protons from the booster on a beryllium target, with %
 %4 x10to12 delivered in a narrow spill of approximately 1.6 micros at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. 
 %The projected number of protons incident on the target (POT) per year for the BNB is %
 %about 2 x 10to 20 POT.
 %The rates expected per year when running in neutrino mode for 1 ton of water %
 %(the approximate usable fiducial volume) are about 16K neutrino interactions, %
 %where 11K of those would be numu CC interactions. 
 %This spectrum peaks ideally in the region of interest at 700 MeV as shown left of Figure 2 %
 %and has the target rate of neutrino interactions per year.
 %The spectrum and rates are based on BNB flux simulated data provided by Zarko Pavlovic (FNAL)%
 %appropriately propagated to the SciBoone hall.
 
 %The target is made of seven cylindrical slugs for a total target length of 71.1 cm, %
 %or about 1.7 inelastic interaction lengths.
 %The beryllium target is surrounded by a magnetic focusing horn, bending and %
 %sign-selecting the secondary particles that emerge from the interactions in the target along
 %the direction pointing to the SciBooNE detector.
 %The focusing is produced by the toroidal magnetic field present in the air volume %
 %between the horn’s two coaxial conductors made of aluminum alloy. 
 %The horn current pulse is approximately a half-sinusoid of amplitude 174 kA, 143 s long, %
 %synchronized to each beam spill. 
 %The polarity of the horn current flow can be (and has been) switched, in order to %
 %focus negatively charged mesons, and therefore produce an antineutrino instead of a neutrino beam.
 %The beam of focused, secondary mesons emerging from the target/horn region is further collimated, %
 %via passive shielding, and allowed to decay into neutrinos in a cylindrical decay %
 %region filled with air at atmospheric pressure, 50 m long and 90 cm in radius. 
 %A beam absorber located at the end of the decay region stops the hadronic and muonic %
 %component of the beam, and only a pure neutrino beam pointing toward the detector remains, %
 %mostly from a pion to mu+ nuofmu decays.



 \section{Resistive Wall Monitor}
 %A resistive wall monitor measures the image charge that flows along the vacuum %
 %chamber following the beam. The image charge has equal magnitude but opposite sign.
 %Depending on the beam velocity, the image charge will lag behind and be spread out along its path. 
 %The ultimate bandwidth of such a detector is limited by this spreading of %
 %the electric field lines between the beam and the inside walls of the beam pipe.
 %The spreading angle is approximately 1/ gamma for relativistic beams ( gamma is the ratio %
 %of total energy to rest energy). 
 %The estimated bandwidth limit from spreading is 47 GHz at injection to the Main Injector %
 %for a 3 cm radius pipe and 8 GeV proton energy. 
 %In practice, the detector response is difficult to maintain above the microwave cutoff %
 %frequency of the beam pipe,measured to be 1.5 GHz for the elliptical beam pipe used in %
 %the Main Injector. 
 %Above cutoff, the characteristic impedance of the beam pipe and the impedance of nearby %
 %structures such as bellows or changes in geometry can effect accuracy.
 
 %In order to measure the image current, the beam pipe is cut and a resistive gap is %
 %inserted (Figure 1). 
 %Various ferrite cores are used to force the image current through the resistive gap rather %
 %than allowing it to flow through other conducting paths.
 %In addition to image current, other currents are often found flowing along the beam pipe. 
 %The gap and cores are placed inside a metal can to shunt these “noise” currents around %
 %rather than through the resistive gap. 
 %The inductance of the cores and the resistance of the gap forms a high pass filter with %
 %a corner frequency of R/2piL, typically a few kilohertz.
 %Above this frequency, cores act to minimize the net current through their center %
 %by inducing a current through the resistive gap that just cancels the beam current.
 %The gap impedance is chosen to be well below the impedance of the cores inside the shielding can. %
 %Several types of ferrite and microwave absorbers are used to maximize the impedance and %
 %minimize resonances within the desired bandwidth. 
 %The Main Injector shielding can has an impedance greater than 30 ohms with the ferrite cores. 
 %In parallel with the 1 ohm gap impedance, 30 ohms can cause frequency dependent errors %
 %of pm1.5\% or 0.15 db.
 %If the charge density around the circumference of the gap is not uniform, the voltage %
 %across the gap will vary around the circumference. 
 %The gap will act as an azimuthal transmission line transporting charge until the %
 %voltage equalizes. 
 %The time domainresponse of the detector would be distorted during this time. 
 %Position detectors have been made by exploiting this effect. 
 %The elliptical shape of the Main Injector pipe aggravates this problem (Figure 2). 
 %To overcome this problem, a round geometry is used for the gap and the signals from %
 %several monitor points equally spaced around the circumference are combined to form a single output.
